# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
items=[153,147,124,102]
print("The sum of the items in the list is ", sum(items))
```

## Output
![439076073-aee49743-c56d-4a2e-8e7b-aa2ff25e11df](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a5b44f0-7cfb-42c3-8757-888583aa3ee6)

## Result
Hence the program executed successfully!
