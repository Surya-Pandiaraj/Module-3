# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x = ("s", "8", "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print('n' in x)
print('8' in x)
```

## Output
![439082738-c1a6290b-17b4-44d3-ad65-5504f2fe900f](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35f0d8dc-ea31-4c92-a839-63b8ee8f556b)

## Result
Hence the program executed successfully!
